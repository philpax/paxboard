# `paxboard`

`paxboard` is my personal `homepage` alternative that serves the needs of one person: me. I will literally write my own dashboard in Rust than spend any time configuring an existing service with YAML. I hate YAML almost as much as I hate the Python programming language.

There is no reason for you to use this.
